# Intermediate Web Dev
Congratulations! You've made it to your first assignment.
In this assignment, we will be growing our skills at working together as a team. The best way to work on a team is through version control.

### Assignment Details
- Make sure you've got [git](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) set up on your computer. You can use git through the command line or through [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
- Fork this repository
- In your new forked repository (you'll know it's yours because the name will look something like: **username/int-web-dev**), create a file in the students folder with your name and follow the instructions in the "Students Profile Page" section

#### Student Profile Page (your HTML page)
In this file, we'd like to know a little bit about you.
Make sure to include at least:
- 1 heading tag (h1-h6)
- 3 paragraph tags
- 2 external links
- 1 ordered list
- 1 unordered list
- 1 image
- 1 link to go back to the home page

Your student profile page should link to the main `index.html` page so that when your name is clicked, you are re-directed to your student profile page. 

Bonus:
Give us a little bit of style!
